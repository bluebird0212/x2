"""DropValues policy — USER_DECISION 2026-09-26 and 2026-10-10.

The official per-DropValueID budget values are lost with the official server data
(known_unknowns #1/#2). Revival replaces the former unlimited 27x1,000,000 budget
with a three-tier economy: every AddADCGroup receives the tier's value cap, and
JudgeDropItem (official client code) throttles drops against it.

Tier classification reuses the OFFICIAL SectionTable.DifficultyLevel axis
(E_Difficulty1..10; main-story/unknown sections use 0). It is NOT stamina-derived:
stamina co-varies with difficulty but the tier input is the difficulty ordinal.
Sections without a difficulty level fall back to MID with telemetry.
Approved 2026-10-10: only group 5 on exported eligible sections is overridden
using 100%=3000; official per-section percentages precede a compatibility curve.
Battlepass, unknown difficulty and unconfirmed equipment sources keep the tiers.

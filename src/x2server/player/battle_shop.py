"""关卡内商店 (in-battle shop): the stock the client cannot compute itself.

The live client asked message 157 (``C2L_RequestInsideBattleShop``) with
``shopID 400201, level 4, sectionId 2110151`` and the server had no handler, so it
answered nothing at all and the shop panel stayed empty - a known message with no
reply is invisible in the game, it just looks like an empty store.

Three of the four inputs are recovered from the client's own tables
(``tools/build_battle_shop.py`` writes them into data/battle_shop.json):

* ``table/MazeShop``: ``ShopID`` + ``FloorInterval`` -> the six ``GroupID`` slots
  of that floor, e.g. 400201 floor 4 -> 30201..30206.
* ``table/CurrencyType``: TpyeId 903 = 棱镜 (item 1237903), the currency the
  in-stage shop spends and that is cleared at settlement.
* ``table/Item``: every 用途场景 = 迷宫内 item, i.e. the consumables, 义体药剂,
  元素结晶 and 圣遗物 (the actual purchaseable 增益).

The fourth input - which group sold which item, and at what price - was decided by
the original server and is gone. Slots are therefore paired positionally with the
item families and priced by declared Revival policy; both are recorded in the
catalog so a wrong guess stays visible.

A tester reported the 黑暗金字塔 chapter's own relics (e.g. 1004635 溜了溜了溜了)
never showed up in its shop. Two things were wrong:

* the offer was seeded with ``shop+floor`` only, so the same six items were picked
  for every player and every run - a relic the single fixed pick did not land on
  (1004635 among them) was unreachable for the whole server. The seed now mixes the
  player and the run uuid (``data/economy_runs``), so each battle rolls its own
  stock while re-opening a shop inside that battle stays stable.
* even a per-run roll is a lottery against the full 圣遗物 block. The relic slots
  are therefore narrowed first to the current chapter's recommended relics
  (``data/relic_recommend.json``, built from client table/RelicRecommend) when that
  intersection is non-empty, which is what makes the stage's own relics appear.

Money handling: the in-stage currency is earned and spent *inside* the battle, and
the client never reports the amount to the server (there is no message for it in
the client's registry; only the local ``DropCurrencyProto``/``ProfileCurrency``
counters exist). The server therefore records the purchase and echoes the price it
sent, and the client settles its own prism counter. Nothing is charged to the
persistent bag, because the item is cleared at settlement anyway.

"""The in-battle shop must offer each stage's own relics, per player and per run.

Tester report 2026-10-04: 黑暗金字塔 (chapter 2010500) never showed its own relics,
notably 1004635 溜了溜了溜了. The offer used to be seeded with shop+floor only, so
every player saw the same six items forever, and the 圣遗物 slots were a lottery
against the whole id block. These cases pin both halves of the fix: the per-run seed
and the chapter-relic narrowing.
